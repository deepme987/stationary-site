# Stationary Site

A site to smoothen the process of stationary purchaces in a college premises.
The website aims to make the process of purchasing stationary products online on an intranet campus with an aim in mind to avoid hassle at the counter, especially during submission days. Students can order their required products, optionally make payment online, and collect the order once it's ready. Similarly, to tackle the issue of Xerox and Prints, we propose a concept of tokens. A student may book a token in an available slot in advance so that he doesn't have to stand in long queues.
